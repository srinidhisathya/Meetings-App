Meetings-Application: 

The meetings application is an app that showcases our meetings on the page. It allows us to search for meetings, add our new meetings, and excuse ourselves from any meeting. We can also add new teams with other members or excuse ourselves from a team. We also have the feature of signing in and signing up.

In the project directory, first run:
npm install
